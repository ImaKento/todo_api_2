# Docker and Prisma Setup Guide

This guide outlines the steps required to set up your application using Docker with a PostgreSQL database managed by Prisma.

## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine.
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
- Basic understanding of Docker commands.

## Steps to Set Up the Environment

### 1. Access Application Container Shell

Start an interactive shell session inside your application container:

```bash
docker exec -it <your-app-container-name> /bin/bash
```

Replace `<your-app-container-name>` with the name or ID of your application's Docker container.

### 2. Run Prisma Migration

Apply database schema changes using Prisma migrations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

This command initializes and applies a new migration named `init`.

### 3. Seed Database

Populate the database with initial data:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```

Ensure you have a seeding script ready in your Prisma project.

### 4. Launch Prisma Studio

Use Prisma Studio to visually manage and inspect your PostgreSQL database:

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

This opens up a web-based interface where you can view and edit your data.

### 5. Access Database Container Shell

Start an interactive shell session inside your database container:

```bash
docker exec -it <your-db-container-name> /bin/bash
```

Replace `<your-db-container-name>` with the name or ID of your database's Docker container.

### 6. Connect to PostgreSQL

Login to the PostgreSQL database using `psql`:

```bash
psql -U postgres -d Todo_db
```

This command connects you as the `postgres` user to the `Todo_db` database.

### 7. List All Tables

To see all tables in the current database, run:

```sql
\d
```

This displays a list of all tables with their schema details.

### 8. View Table Details

To get detailed information about a specific table, use:

```sql
\d "Todos"
```

Replace `"Todos"` with your desired table name to see its structure and columns.

### 9. Verify Data in the Table

To check the data stored in the `Todos` table, execute:

```sql
SELECT * FROM "Todos";
```

This query retrieves all records from the specified table.

## Conclusion

Following these steps will help you set up a fully functional development environment with Docker and Prisma for managing 
your PostgreSQL database. Ensure to replace placeholder values with actual names or IDs specific to your setup.
```

Make sure to customize placeholders like `<your-app-container-name>` and `<your-db-container-name>` according to your 
project's configuration before running the commands. This `README.md` provides a structured approach for setting up and 
managing your development environment using Docker and Prisma effectively.
